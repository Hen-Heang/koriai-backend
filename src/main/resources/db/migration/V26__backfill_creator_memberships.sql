-- Backfill creator memberships for goals that have no membership row for their
-- owner. Natively created goals get a 'creator' goal_members row (GoalService),
-- but goals migrated from the Orbit/Supabase data set were inserted without one,
-- so owner-only actions (share-code regenerate, invite, remove member) 403'd.
--
-- Idempotent: only inserts where the owner has no membership row yet.
